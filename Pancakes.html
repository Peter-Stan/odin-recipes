                            <li>2 eggs</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Steps</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>In a food processor or in a large bowl, combine the whole wheat flour, white flour, 
                                    wheat germ or oats, baking powder, baking soda, brown sugar, and salt.</li>
                                <li>Cut the butter into small pieces with a knife, and add the butter to the flour-mixture. 
                                    Mix until the mixture has a sand-like consistency.</li>
                                <li>Make a well in the center of the flour-butter mixture, and add the buttermilk and eggs. Stir until the liquids are fully incorporated.</li>
                                <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and grease the surface with 1 tablespoon of butter or oil. Ladle the batter onto the surface to form 4 inch pancakes. 
                                    Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 2 minutes.</li>
